# Italian lady beats you at Rock Paper Scissors


This project is a computer vision practice:
+ uses opencv for webcam frame capturing
+ uses mediapipe for hand tracking
+ uses pydub for playing audio segments
+ audio segments obtained from https://ttsmp3.com


## Notes:
+ The project was intended to be a CNN practice but I realized a hand tracking model is much more efficient. Please ignore the top few lines commented out in the main file, as those are for loading samples for the CNN.

+ Try to use hand signs close to the middle of your webcam and try to do the signs parallel to the webcam, this means the palm of your hand is ideally facing the webcam or yourself, whichever is more comfortable.
